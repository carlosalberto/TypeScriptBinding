IMMEDIATE:

* Add a TypeScriptLanguageBinding
* Simple empty file and project (xft and xpt).
* Add some serializable classes (compiler params, project params).
* Add some info in the msbuilditemtypes section?
* Add policy sets.
	* When we do this, we can re-enable tab-to-spaces support.
* Move TypeScript namespace to TypeScriptBinding.

* Look for a CSharpFormatter and move it here.
* What if isSomethingSelected is something that can change across the state of the KeyPress() method?
* EditorIndentation.GuessSemicolon..() takes into account get/set. I'm not very sure we have them around for TS.
* Add support for on-fly-formatting (and formatting in general). -> Add the formatter in the addin def.
* Add ambience.
* Add a parser (this can be based on the TypeScript runtime itself).
* Add syntax mode.
* Add refactoring.
* Add a resolver.
* Add tooltip.
* Replace icons with some correct ones.
* Looks like enum declarations are gonna change a little while. Check later and update.
