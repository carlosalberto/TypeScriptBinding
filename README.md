TypeScriptBinding
=================

Minimum binding for MD for implementing a decent and complete indent engine.

This is not intended, so far, to be a complete TypeScript language binding for MD.
The idea is to have a testbed to implement/port/test a basic indent engine, based from
the C# (since they are quite similar).

Hopefully later we can move this to another, working language binding with all the fancy stuff.
